Implement and write tests for the following:

* Ignore private methods in Objects class
* Included spread dependencies in dependency cycle check
* Dynamic dependency that already provided by child. Currently ignores parameter.
* Dynamic dependency already exposed by parent. Parameter currently overrides exposed instance.
* Throw compilation error for unused dependencies
* Duplicate factory combinations

* Consider factoring out BaseTest logic into module to be shared between core2 and models test sources.
* Do Spreadable types need to be public?
